        <p>
            Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods 
            that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs able to 
            inject venom. They are the largest order of arachnids 
            and rank seventh in total species diversity among all 
            orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on 
            every continent except for Antarctica, and have become 
            established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions 
            of air and sea colonization. As of July 2019, at least 
            48,200 spider species, and 120 families have been recorded
            by taxonomists. However, there has been dissension
            within the scientific community as to how all these
            families should be classified, as evidenced by the 
            over 20 different classifications that have been 
            proposed since 1900.

                        The black widow is responsible for more than 2,500 visits to poison control centers every year in the U.S. It is one species that can be found from the United States and parts
                        of Canada through Latin America and the West Indies.

                        The brown widow is thought to have evolved in Africa, 
                        but the first specimen described came from South America. 
                        It is classified as an invasive species elsewhere around 
                        the world. Brown widow populations have appeared in southern 
                        California, the Caribbean, the U.S. states of the Gulf Coast, 
                        as well as in Japan, South Africa and Madagascar, Australia, 
                        and Cyprus

                            The third widow spider on this list is the red widow, 
                            or red-legged widow. The spiderâ€™s appearance is distinguished 
                            from other widow spiders by its reddish cephalothorax and 
                            legs and its reddish-brown to black colored abdomen. 
                            Many red widows have a red mark on the underside of the 
                            abdomen, which may be either hourglass-shaped, triangle-shaped, 
                            or indistinct.
